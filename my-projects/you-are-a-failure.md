# You are a Failure!

> 20 March 2022, _**You are a Failure!**_ has been published to Microsoft Store, _(and they accepted it!)_

This is my first C# Windows Application and also my first app to be published to Microsoft Store

### Why I made this app

Everything has been explained here [https://leomotors.github.io/you-are-a-failure](https://leomotors.github.io/you-are-a-failure/)

TL;DR because I am a Failure!

### The process of making it

What I want from this app is, if I'm going to create a Windows App, why not make it Native-Looking. The way to do it is with WinUI. Currently, the only methods are UWP or Windows App SDK with XAML or React Native. But I chose UWP.

#### UWP vs Windows App SDK

UWP is deprecated technology and is to be replaced by Windows App SDK. But despite that, it is still very new and lacks some nice features "Mica". So, I decided to go with UWP for now.

For everyone who wants to create a nice WinUI UWP app, I recommend you these tips

* Learn C# First, I recommend C# over C++ because it is easier (yes, why?)
* Study the concept of XAML, XAML is invented 10 years ago along with WPF and remained pretty much the same. Most of the time, StackOverflow from many years ago can still help you!
* XAML Controls Gallery (Or now named WinUI 2 Gallery) is the must-have app.
* Try viewing the source code of the app such as [WinUI Gallery](https://github.com/microsoft/WinUI-Gallery) or [DevToys](https://github.com/veler/DevToys), \~\~~~Don't look at my app's source code, it is bad~~
* Lastly, Good Luck!

### Uploading to Microsoft Store

The process is very simple. First, you need to pay 19ðŸ’² as entrance fee.

After that create an app, set info upload package and wait for approval!

Base on my experience of 5 Submissions, the process can be as fast as 1 hour and as long as 1 day. Note that other people have ever wait longer than this.
